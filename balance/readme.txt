The main sample generation code is in main.py file.

To run the Gen Ai (llm) you need to first install Ollama (if not already installed) from ollama.org

then run the command in command prompt.

' ollama run llama3 '

this code uses llama3 for sample generation. after executing the above command run

' ollama ps '  	to check whether llama3 is running or not.


after running the above commands in command prompt you just have to change the excel file path the place where the generated data will be stored.
